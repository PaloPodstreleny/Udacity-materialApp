 # Udacity: Material app

In this project, we redesigned an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

This project gives an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

### Learning outcome
* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.
